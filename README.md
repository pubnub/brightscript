    subscribeKey: "demo",
    publishKey: "demo",
    uuid: "roku-client",

```  
Full list of parameters which can be used for client configuration listed below:

| `authKey`                      | roString |    No    | Reference on key which is used along with every request to **PubNub** service to identify client user. |
| `uuid`                         | roString |    No    | Reference on unique client identifier used to identify concrete client user from another which currently use **PubNub** services. |

## Callbacks
All API expect subscribe/unsubscribe accept `callback` functions as second function parameter.  
```brightscript
client.<api-function>({<parameters>}, <callback>, <context>)
```  

Data pulling API require callbacks and data modification API allow to pass _invalid_ or completelly ignore it and pass only list of parameters.  
Because callback functions will be called outside of scope where they has been called it maybe required to do something in response on modified/fetched data - for this purpose _context_ should be used. _context_ is optional parameter and can be ignored, but if it has been passed then additional parameter should be added to callback function declaration:  
```brightscript
publishCallback = function(status as Object, context as Object)
end function
```  

## Integration
To properly integrate **PubNub** client into your application it should be called from `run-loop`. After client has been created and configured it need to start handling **roUrlEvent** events and trigger internal timers - to make it happen client provide function `handleMessage` which should be called by application.  
Here is how client can be _integrated_:  
```brightscript
' Prepare shared message port.
' Message port should be used for both application / user events handling and PubNub client
' 'run-loop'
messagePort = createObject("roMessagePort")

' Create and configure PubNub client instance.
client = PubNub({
    subscribeKey: "demo-36",
    publishKey: "demo-36",
    uuid: "roku-client",
}, messagePort)

while true
    message = wait(250, messagePort)
    pubnubCanHandle = client.handleMessage(message)
    if type(message) = "roUrlEvent" AND pubnubCanHandle = false then
        ' Application request handling code. If client's 'handleMessage' function return
        ' 'false' - it mean what client doesn't recognize request and probably it has been sent
        ' by application and should be handled by it.
    end if

    if message = "roSGScreenEvent" AND message.isScreenClosed() = true then
        client.destroy()
        exit while
    end if

    ' Handle any other user interactions.
end while
```  

**NOTE:** Don't use zero timeout for _wait_ because **PubNub** client won't be able to maintain internal timers and trigger requests timeout events.  
**NOTE:** If it will be required to create another **PubNub** client and invalidate previous one you need to call:  
```brightscript
client.destroy()
```  

## Subscription
### Subscribing
Subscription API use 'event listeners' to provide information about received events / messages or client subscription state change. Listeners is regular associative arrays with fields (status, presence and message) which represent desired events which should be handled by observer.  
Here is an example of event listener which will be used later:  

```brightscript
objectEventListener = {
    status: function(client as Object, status as Object)
        ?"Status change:", status
        ' Check example application for possible state variations.
        if status.error = true AND status.operation = PNOperationType().PNSubscribeOperation then
            if status.automaticallyRetry = true then
                ' It is possible to cancel automatic retry
                ' if required using client's function:
                client.cancelSubscriptionRetry()
            end if
        end if
    end function
    presence: function(client as Object, presence as Object)
        ?"Received '"+presence.data.presenceEvent+"' presence event with details:", presence.data.presence
    end function
    message: function(client as Object, message as Object)
        ?"Received message on '"+message.data.channel+"': ",message.data.message
    end function
}
```  

After observer object has been created it should be registered with corresponding function:  
```brightscript
client.addListener(objectEventListener)
```  

**NOTE:** When client's state change and messages observation not required anymore, it can be disabled:  
```brightscript
' Unregister specific listener.
client.removeListener(objectEventListener)

' Unregister all listeners.  
client.removeAllListeners()
```  

To perform regular subscription to channel and groups with presence state next subscribe request can be used:  
```brightscript
client.subscribe({
    channels: ["pubnub-channel", "roku-channel"]
    channelGroups: ["pubnub-group", "brightscript-group"]
    withPresence: false
    "state": {"pubnub-channel": {"welcome": "online"}}
})
```  

Full list of parameters which can be used with this API listed below:  

|        Name        |        Type        | Required | Description |
| ------------------ |:------------------:|:--------:|:------------|
| `channels`         |      roArray       |    No    | List of channel names on which client should try to subscribe. |
| `channelGroups`    |      roArray       |    No    | List of channel group names on which client should try to subscribe. |
| `withPresence`     |      Boolean       |    No    | Whether presence observation should be enabled for `channels` and/or `groups` or not. |
| `state`            | roAssociativeArray |    No    | Reference on associative array which stores key-value pairs based on channel / group names and value which should be assigned to them. |
| `filterExpression` |      roString      |    No    | Expression which defined conditions basing on which published message should be accepted by client. |  


### Unsubscribing
**PubNub** client provide two functions which can be used to unsubscribe from channels and/or groups: `unsubscribe` and `unsubscribeAll`.  
`unsubscribeAll` is function which with single call unsubscribe client from all channel and groups (including presence channels and groups). Usage example:  
```brightscript
client.unsubscribeAll()
```  

`unsubscribe` allow to unsubscribe from particular channel(s) and / or group(s). Usage example:  
```brightscript
client.unsubscribe({
    channels: ["pubnub-channel", "roku-channel"]
    channelGroups: ["brightscript-group"]
})
```  

Full list of parameters which can be used with this API listed below:

| `channelGroups`    |      roArray       |    No    | List of channel group names from which client should try to unsubscribe. |
| `withPresence`     |      Boolean       |    No    | Whether client should disable presence observation on specified channel(s) and / or

### List of channels / groups
**PubNub** provide interface which allow to retrieve list of channels and groups on which client subscribed at this moment: `channels` and `channelGroups`. Usage example:  
```brightscript
channels = client.channels()
channelGroups = client.channelGroups()
```  

### Presence observation
**PubNub** client provide interface which allow to check whether presence observation enabled for particular channel or channel group. In example below shown how to enabled presence observation on channel if not enabled yet:  
```brightscript
if client.presenceEnabledForChannel("roku-channel") = false then
    client.subscribe({channels: ["roku-channel-pnpres"]})
end if
```

```brightscript
publishCallback = function(status as Object)
    if status.error = false then
        ' Handle successful message publish.
    else
        ' Handle message publish error.
        ?"Message publish did fail with error details:",status.errorData
    end if
end function

client.publish({
